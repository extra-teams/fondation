    'message2' => 'In the history of mankind, our continent continues, as in the past, to be in last place 
                    among the peoples. It is still the ideal place for civil wars (now complicated by jihadism), 
                    political violence, epidemics with the resurgence of the Ebola virus, famines, illiteracy, etc.',
    'message3' => 'It is true that for several years now, international institutions, notably the IMF, have 
                    been announcing a constantly improving situation in Africa with an overall growth rate 
                    above 5%. This is a good indicator. But is our happiness perfect?',
    'message4' => 'This high rate of economic growth may be good for morale, but in practice it still does not 
                    anslate into economic and social development for the population: the standard of living is 
                    still derisory and poverty is still the most common problem in almost all African countries. 
                    Growth remains appreciable only at the macroeconomic level, while the eternal ills that 
                    have always given Africa a bad name remain! The terrible epidemic of the Ebola virus that 
                    has hit several countries in the West African sub-region that are unable to overcome it, 
                    has brutally reminded us of the precariousness of the global situation of our continent!',
    'message5' => 'This sad reality, which was being obscured by all the speeches and projections on economic 
                    growth, must today, more than yesterday, make every African aware of the issue of 
                    development in our countries: each of us, as individuals, must take ownership of it and 
                    no longer leave it in the hands of our political decision makers.',
    'message6' => 'Félix Houphouët-Boigny, founding father and great builder of modern Côte d\'Ivoire, 
                    launched this memorable exhortation to the daughters and sons of this country as to their supreme duty 
                    to work for its multifaceted development: "It is time, high time that each Ivorian asks himself: \'Have 
                    I done, well done for my country what I must?',
    'message7' => 'This exhortation, in view of the delay of our countries on the scale of development, is of 
                    great concern to all of Africa. At a time when, under the impetus of our political leaders, 
                    our peoples are engaged in the march towards the emergence of our countries, it is the time 
                    for each African to ask himself or herself about his or her actual and possible contribution

                    promotion of social cohesion, etc., show us the way forward. Through their hard work, 
                    their creativity, their entrepreneurial spirit, their self-sacrifice, etc., they have 
                    such a powerful impact on our societies in a positive and noble sense, that they alone 
                    constitute powerful engines of progress for our countries. "What if every African, we then 
                    ask, sacrificed himself to build a work similar to theirs?" Then we would have found the 
                    key to Africa\'s development! Because put together, these works would have an even more 
                    powerful impact on our countries and would significantly boost their progress on the
